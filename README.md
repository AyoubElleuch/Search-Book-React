# Future_Search_Book_App
Search Book App

This is a search book app built using React, Redux, and TypeScript. It allows users to search for books and view details about each book.
Please note that this app was not focused on the design and user interface. The purpose of this app is to implement React, Redux, and Typescript.

Features:
- View book details including title, author, description, and cover image
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
- Filters books by categories and filter them by relevance

Installation:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AyoubElleuch/Future_Search_Book_App.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies: npm install

Usage:
1. Start the development server: npm start
2. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000

Technologies Used:
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

Testing:
The app was thoroughly tested manually as it is a small application and does not need any Jest or React Testing Library.
However, testing the app using the previously mentioned methods is easy and I can provide them on request.

Acknowledgements:
